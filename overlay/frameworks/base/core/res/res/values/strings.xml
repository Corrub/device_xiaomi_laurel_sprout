    <!-- The bounding path of the cutout region of the main built-in display.
         Must either be empty if there is no cutout region, or a string that is parsable by
         {@link android.util.PathParser}.
         The path is assumed to be specified in display coordinates with pixel units and in
         the display's native orientation, with the origin of the coordinate system at the
         center top of the display.
         To facilitate writing device-independent emulation overlays, the marker `@dp` can be
         appended after the path string to interpret coordinates in dp instead of px units.
         Note that a physical cutout should be configured in pixels for the best results.
         Example for a 10px x 10px square top-center cutout:
                <string ...>M -5,0 L -5,10 L 5,10 L 5,0 Z</string>
         Example for a 10dp x 10dp square top-center cutout:
                <string ...>M -5,0 L -5,10 L 5,10 L 5,0 Z @dp</string>
